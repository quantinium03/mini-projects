    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <h3>For the soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons Butter or olive oil </li>
        <li>2 bay leaf or tej patta (small to medium-sized) – fresh or dried</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onions or 1 medium onion</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic or 2 to 3 small to medium garlic cloves</li>
        <li>500 grams tomatoes or 6 to 7 medium to large tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup water or low sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon raw sugar or white sugar</li>
        <li>freshly crushed black pepper – as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the croutons</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup bread cubes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 light pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 to 2 pinch freshly crushed black pepper </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley or coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream – optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions : </h2>
    <h3>Cooking Tomatoes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter until it melts in a saucepan or a pot. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. </li>
        <li>Add bay leaves and sauté for a few seconds. Add chopped onions and garlic. Stir and sauté until onions soften for about 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and salt. Mix well. </li>
        <li>Cover pan and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until tomatoes soften or for about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>There is no need to add water. But do keep an eye when the tomatoes are simmering. If the liquids dry up then add a splash of water and continue cooking. </li>
        <li>After the tomatoes have softened, remove from the heat and cool. Take out the bay leaves and discard.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Blending and Straining</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the tomato mixture has cooled to a point that’s safe to work with, add it to a blender jar. You can also use an immersion blender. </li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth consistency. </li>
        <li>You have the option of straining the puree through a strainer for an even smoother soup, but this step isn’t necessary.</li>
        <li>If you do choose to strain the puree, move a spoon through it so that everything is strained except the seeds. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Simerring Further</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the tomato puree back into the pot, and add water and sugar. Mix and stir well.</li>
        <li>Simmer on a low heat until the soup becomes hot but not boiling. </li>
        <li>Season with freshly crushed black pepper and stir. </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and stir in, 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, depending on desired richness.</li>
        <li>Mix well, taste, and add more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Toasting Bread</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When the tomato mixture is cooling, you can make the bread croutons. Mix together the bread cubes, olive oil, salt and freshly crushed black pepper in a baking tray. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven for about 3 to 5 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit) until bread cubes are golden and crisp. Or, you can toast the bread cubes in a skillet until golden brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot tomato soup into bowls. Add the croutons directly on top of the soup, or serve on the side. You can also garnish the tomato soup with a bit of freshly chopped parsley or coriander leaves (cilantro) or basil sprigs or mint leaves.</li>
        <li>This soup is great served fresh, but also keeps well in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 4 days.</li>
